# snake-ladder-cpp
A simple console-based Snake and Ladder game built in C++ for two players. Beginner-friendly project to practice board logic, random dice rolls, and turn-based gameplay.

It showcases the use of **basic programming concepts** like control structures, loops, functions, and arrays — without relying on any GUI library. Just good old console output! ✨

## 📖 About the Project
I made this project as part of learning the **fundamentals of programming**. The idea was to implement a classic board game (Snake & Ladder) using only the basics of C++.  

- No advanced libraries or frameworks.  
- Focus on clean logic and step-by-step learning.  
- Showcases how beginners can combine small concepts into a working project.

## 🕹️ How to Play
- The game is for **two players**.  
- Players take turns to roll the dice.  
- First to reach **position 100** wins the game.  
- Landing on a snake’s head takes you **down** 🐍.  
- Landing on a ladder’s bottom takes you **up** 🪜.  
- The board is displayed in the console after every turn.
